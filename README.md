## 💡 Inspiration

This app was inspired by my own journey of building self-discipline and balancing multiple goals (Competitive Programming, GSoC prep, MUNs, etc.). The buddy system gamifies studying and creates a fun pressure to stay on track. Built solo as my first full Django project! ❤️

---

## 🧹 How it Works

1. **Sign up / Log in**
2. **Invite a Study Buddy** by their username
3. **Add tasks** with Pomodoro goals and deadlines
4. **Start sessions** to begin your focused work
5. If you miss deadlines, your buddy gets **reward points**
6. At the end of the month, you're encouraged to **pay up in real life** 💸
